# ViteConf 2022 ⚡

> Making Web Development Instant

This is the main development repository for the ViteConf 2022 online conference website powering [viteconf.org](https://viteconf.org).

This means that the DX comes out of the box with:

- 💡 Instant Server Start
- ⚡️ Lightning Fast HMR
- 🛠️ Rich Features
- 📦 Optimized Build
- 🔩 Universal Plugin Interface
- 🔑 Fully Typed APIs
